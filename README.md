# Ship-and-Aircraft-Detection
This is the project which i did in my summer internship with IIRS ISRO
I used the Implemented the Yolo and Faster RCNN Model to detect ship in SAR (i.e.Santhertic Aparture Radar) images and Optical images of Aircraft

Read the "Ship Detection in SAR images of Ship.pdf" file to know about exact work in SAR Images.
Read the "AIRPLANE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION IN OPTICAL IMAGES.pdf" file file for the work of Aircraft Images

I also implimented Faster RCNN and Yolo for building detection of Satellite Images  To understaand the work read "Building Detection Faster RCNN.pdf" and "Building Detection Yolo.pdf"


Yolo v3 Building Detection 
see the "Yolo_Building.ipynb" file for python code and for whole folder visit https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tm9IJnwgujeaD-iKiHz5qVg1uwoxVZpO?usp=sharing
See "Faster_RCNN_Building.ipynb" file for building detection using faster rcnn network
